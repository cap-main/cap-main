Hi, my name is Frank Johnson I'm a Web Developer, Games Developer, App Developer, Bots Developer. I work at the company. discord In the Technical Support Area I Started My Passion About Programming Early At 10 Years Old I Started Making Scripts To Take Down Whois Sites etc, Nowadays I Study Pentester Information Security. Today I know 98% about programming language. I'm not a programming king because I have to learn more and more because technology is growing absurd And we always have to change our batteries and put new ones in order to understand the concept of technology.
